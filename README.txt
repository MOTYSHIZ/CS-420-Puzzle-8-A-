To run the file, go to the /out/production/CS420p1/ and open the command line there. 
In the command line, type "java puzzle8"
If that does not work, type "java -cp F:\Programming\CS-420-Puzzle-8-A-\out\production\CS420p1 puzzle8" , 
but instead, replacing the "F:\Programming\..." path with the file path leading up to the CS420p1 folder.
